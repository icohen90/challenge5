# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

<h2>URL:<h2><br> <a href="https://icohen90.github.io/challenge5/"> URL of Website</a>

#Description: 
The site is essentially a daily calendar that starts from 9:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon. There is a textarea box to type in whatever you need to do during
the day at that specific time. There is also a save button to save your information in localStorage so that it persists even if you refresh the page. Finally, depending upon what time of day it is the textarea box has a different background color: the past:orange, present:red, and future:green.
